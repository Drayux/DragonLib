### DragonLib : Modern data structures for modern C programs
---

## Work in progress
This project is currently very early in the works.  
The goal is to offer a number of modern programming paradigms into C, via means
of macros and managed data structures.  

Features I'm currently considering are:  
`Common data structures (List, stack, queue, tree, dictionary, set, etc)  
Rudimentary garbage collection  
JSON-parsing for dicts (akin to python)  
Range-based for loops  
File-parsing utilities (likely akin to stringstream)  
API-integration utilities  
Regex compiler  
Program console/scripting interface  `

Of course, some or many of these may be ruled out if I cannot devise a reasonable
way to do this at compile time.  


## Usage and CLI
TODO when I actually have an interface.  


## Licensing notes
Honeslty, I'd be baffled if anyone but me sought to use this library. I am building
it with the goal of being a central utility in all of my future C projects. If
anyone else finds use out of this as well, I'd find that incredibly cool.  

Admittedly I still need to read through the LICENSE I've selected, but I welcome
any to use this in personal or commercial products free of charge, requesting only
that this repo be linked somewhere in the docs, and that any super cool features
be made into a pull request.  

Happy coding!
